# Project Instructions for Claude

## Auto-commit on Feature Completion

When a feature, bug fix, or task is completed (either explicitly stated by the user saying things like "done", "that works", "perfect", "looks good", etc., or implicitly when the work is clearly finished and confirmed working), automatically commit the changes without waiting to be asked.

Use descriptive commit messages that summarize what was done.
